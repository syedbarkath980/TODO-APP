# ✅ TODO APP – JavaScript Project

This is my **first ever JavaScript project** where I built a simple and clean **Todo App** using only:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

This project helped me understand how real DOM manipulation and events work in JavaScript.

## 🧠 What I learned from this project

While building this project, I learned:

- How to select elements using query selectors
- How to create elements dynamically
- How to attach events using event listeners
- How to update the UI using JavaScript
- How the read-only property works for input fields
- Basic real-world usage of JavaScript events

This project helped me strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals.

## 🔍 Application Logic (Overview)

- When the **ADD** button is clicked, a new task item is created dynamically and added to the list.
- The **DELETE** button removes the selected task from the screen.
- The **EDIT** button allows the task text to be edited.
- After editing, the task becomes read-only again when the mouse leaves the input field.

## ⚠️ Important Note

This application does **not store data permanently**.

If the page is refreshed, all tasks will be removed.

This project is focused only on practicing:

- DOM manipulation
- event handling
- basic JavaScript logic

## 🧭 Future Improvements

<!-- - Store tasks using browser local storage
     - Add a completed or done state for tasks
     - Support adding tasks using the Enter key
     - Improve the editing experience using a save button -->
